# Algorithms Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the **CS321 - Algorithms Analysis and Design** course at **Cairo University - Faculty of Computer and Artificial Intelligence**. Each assignment folder contains tasks related to various algorithmic problems, along with descriptions and implementations.

## Assignment 1: Fibonacci Series, Search Algorithms, Heap, Priority Queue, and Heap Sort


### Assignment Description

#### Task 1: Fibonacci Series
Implement functions to compute the nth Fibonacci number using the following methods:
- **Recursion**
- **Divide and Conquer (Matrix Multiplication)**
- **Dynamic Programming**

#### Task 2: Search Algorithms
Implement both **Sequential Search** and **Binary Search** algorithms with iterative and recursive approaches:
- **Sequential Search (Iterative)**
- **Sequential Search (Recursive)**
- **Binary Search (Iterative)**
- **Binary Search (Recursive)**

#### Task 3: Heap, Priority Queue, and Heap Sort
1. **Heap Implementation**:
   - Insert elements and maintain heap property (heapify).
   - Extract maximum and minimum.
2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use heap to build a priority queue.
   - Insert elements with priority and extract the highest priority element.
3. **Heap Sort**:
   - Use heap to sort an array by building a max heap and sorting through repeated extraction.
