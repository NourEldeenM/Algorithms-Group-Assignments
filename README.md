# Algorithms Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the **CS321 - Algorithms Analysis and Design** course at **Cairo University - Faculty of Computer and Artificial Intelligence**. Each assignment folder contains tasks related to various algorithmic problems, along with descriptions and implementations.

## Assignment 1: Fibonacci Series, Search Algorithms, Heap, Priority Queue, and Heap Sort

### Assignment Description

#### Task 1: Fibonacci Series
Implement functions to compute the nth Fibonacci number using the following methods:
- **Recursion**
- **Divide and Conquer (Matrix Multiplication)**
- **Dynamic Programming**

#### Task 2: Search Algorithms
Implement both **Sequential Search** and **Binary Search** algorithms with iterative and recursive approaches:
- **Sequential Search (Iterative)**
- **Sequential Search (Recursive)**
- **Binary Search (Iterative)**
- **Binary Search (Recursive)**

#### Task 3: Heap, Priority Queue, and Heap Sort
1. **Heap Implementation**:
   - Insert elements and maintain heap property (heapify).
   - Extract maximum and minimum.
2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use heap to build a priority queue.
   - Insert elements with priority and extract the highest priority element.
3. **Heap Sort**:
   - Use heap to sort an array by building a max heap and sorting through repeated extraction.

## Assignment 2: Hashing, Red-Black Tree, and Skip List

### Assignment Description

#### Task 1: Hashing and Collision Resolution Techniques
Define C++ functions to implement the following hashing and collision resolution methods:

1. **Hashing Techniques**:
   - Division Method
   - Multiplication Method
   - Mid Square Method
   - Folding Method

2. **Collision Resolution Techniques**:
   - Chaining Method
   - Open Addressing Method
   - Double Hashing

#### Task 2: Red-Black Tree
Implement the insertion and deletion operations of a red-black tree in C++. Your implementation should:
- Maintain the tree's balance and color properties.
- Support insertion of nodes while ensuring tree balance.
- Support deletion of nodes with appropriate restructuring to uphold red-black properties.

#### Task 3: Skip List
Implement a Skip List data structure in C++ with the following functionalities:
- **Insertion**: Add elements while maintaining probabilistic balancing.
- **Deletion**: Remove elements efficiently.
- **Searching**: Efficiently find elements in the skip list.

**Dynamic Problem**: Use the skip list to solve the following problem:
- **Dynamic Score Updates**: Handle frequent increases and decreases in player scores efficiently.
- **Leaderboard Retrieval**: Quickly retrieve the top N players.
- **Player Management**: Allow players to join, leave, and view their scores dynamically.

### Folder Contents:
- A C++ file for hashing and collision resolution functions.
- A C++ file for red-black tree implementation.
- A C++ file for skip list implementation and dynamic scoring program.
